            <h2>Personal Application Write-Up</h2>
            <p>As I worked on this practicum since the beginning of the semester, I tried to apply the principles I studied in my own life. I worked on strengthening my personal discipleship by improving my spiritual habits. I read the scriptures daily and offered more meaningful prayers. As I did this, I learned to rely on His Atonement and felt greater purpose in my life.<br><br>

            I also strove to “let God prevail” by listening to the words of the prophets and apostles. Each week, I would listen to conference talks and work on applying their teachings. I discussed these talks with my children and husband, and I found that as I learned more about each apostle, I came to love them more and saw their love for all of Heavenly Father’s children.<br><br>
            
            By sharing what I learned with my family, I improved my communication and fostered open dialogue about the gospel. Hearing my children express their understanding and testimonies was a joyful experience.<br><br>
            
            For my personal applications, I showed my husband more gratitude and encouragement, nurtured my children’s faith through consistent Come, Follow Me study at home, and served those in need. These efforts brought increased unity, love, and spiritual strength into my home and life.
